sdl_img
=======


A simple image viewer based on stb_image.h (with the suggested animated gif api extension).

Goals / Focus
================
features I've always wanted in an image viewer
Simple, readable code
not focused on speed, if it's fast enough on my chromebook it's good enough

TODO
====
figure out why certain gifs don't load all the frames
