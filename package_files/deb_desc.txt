Browse images however you want
sdl_img is an image viewer built using the SDL2 and stb_image libraries. Thanks to the latter, it has support for many different image formats including JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, and netpbm.  sdl_img focuses on interesting, unique features:
  
   * multi-image browsing
   * full control of GIF playback
   * vim inspired thumbnail mode
   * list mode
   * create and manage playlists
   * arbitrary rotation
  
It is also highly configurable, in both appearance and behavior, using a lua configuration script to save all your preferences (all accessible via the GUI).
